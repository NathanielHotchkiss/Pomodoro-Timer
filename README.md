# Pomodoro Timer

A Thinkful assignment testing our newfound understanding of React. The timer switches between focus and break time, and can be customized to suit your needs. No need to stare at the countdown, a bell will chime when it's time to switch. The main takeaway from this assignment was breaking down big problems into smaller, more manageable problems. React makes this easy with components!
